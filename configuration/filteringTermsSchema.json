Only attributes of known schemas SHOULD be used here. For attributes that are not part of the known schemas, the 'custom' type MUST be used.\n* 'custom' is anything that doesn't fit the previous categories and mainly for custom dictionaries that have no ontology nor a corresponding attribute in the known schemas.
