Please see the unified [beacon-v2](https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/beacon-v2) repository for ongoing Beacon development.

Beacon Framework version 2

### Introduction

The GA4GH Beacon specification is composed by two parts:

* the Beacon Framework
* the Beacon Models

The Beacon Framework (in *this* repo) is the part that describes the overall structure of the API requests, responses, parameters, the common components, etc. It could also be referred in this document as simply the Framework.

Additional information is now accessible through the [Beacon v2 Documentation](http://docs.genomebeacons.org/framework/).

**NOTE**: This is the project for Beacon v2 framework development. The final Beacon v2 Framework
and Models will be made availble through the unified [`beacon-v2`](https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/beacon-v2) repository.
